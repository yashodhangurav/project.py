# 🎓 Student Exam Result Analysis System

A **Python console-based application** designed to manage and analyze student examination results.
The system supports **CRUD operations**, **result analysis**, and **file-based data persistence**, making it suitable for **academic mini-projects** and **learning data structures, file handling, and OOP in Python**.

---

## 📌 Project Description

The **Student Exam Result Analysis System** analyzes student exam results to determine **pass/fail status** and generate useful **statistical insights** such as pass percentage, average marks, highest marks, and lowest marks.

The project is implemented using:

* **Predefined data structures** (lists and dictionaries)
* **User-defined data structures** (classes)
* **File handling** for permanent storage
* **Menu-driven console interface**

---

## ✨ Features

* Add student records
* View all student results
* Update student details
* Delete student records
* Automatic pass/fail evaluation
* Result statistics and analysis
* Persistent storage using text files

---

## 🧠 Result Analysis Includes

* Total number of students
* Number of students passed
* Number of students failed
* Pass percentage
* Average marks
* Highest marks
* Lowest marks
